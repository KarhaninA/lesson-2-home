        A big attack from Russia hurts Kyiv on November 25. The <br />attack lasts six hours. Five
        people get hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happens on a day when people remember the Holodomor <span>famine</span> in 1932-33. Many
        people die at that time. The attack starts in the early hours. But more
        <span>drones</span> come later. Officials say that Russia attacks 911 times this week. 19
        people die, and 84 people get hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ukraine’s <span>military</span> says that they shoot down 74 drones. Trucks with guns
        already help stop 40% of all Russian drones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Difficult words: <mark>famine</mark> (a long time when people have nothing to eat),
        <mark>drone</mark>(a small flying device), <mark>military</mark> (soldiers).
